- Hi, my name is Marty. I'm also often called some derivative of my username, which is fine as well. 
- I mostly program alone because of circumstance, but I'd love more experience working in a group!
- I find esoteric programming languages very interesting conceptually!
	- I don't often genuinely learn them, though
- Currently learning:
	- Java
- Bucket list to learn: 
	- Python
	- FiM++ 
- Already well versed in: 
	- C
	- C++
	- Harlowe
	- Matlab (though it's somewhat rusty)
- I’m looking to collaborate on fun things with my friends. 
- I'm most accessible through Discord, at robokitty77
	* Please say SOMETHING that serves to distinguish yourself from spam if you message me!
- I don't care what pronouns you use for me
- I prefer gender neutral nouns and terms of address
- I have autism and ADHD, my interests and activities flit around rapidly!
	* I rarely find myself without a personal programming project occupying my time
