- 👋 Hi, I’m @Robokitty77
- 👀 I’m interested in programming alone and with friends
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, with Python on my bucket list. I have Matlab under my belt.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun things with my friends. 
- 📫 How to reach me- Discord is the best, and my username is the same (but all lowercase)
- 😄 Pronouns: any and all, I don't really care!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a college sophomore and a computer science major, and I'm minoring in Spanish!
